# Conclusions

This project is developed in a modular fashion, as is evident from the Development View and Logical View diagrams, and it closely follows the aforementioned object-oriented architecture. It implements a very wide range of Linear Algebra functionality, which is what is intended, and it is simple to integrate with existing libraries and projects, as well as extending with other functionality that might be desired. The code is also very sound, in part due to the simplicity and general coherence of linear algebra subjects, and also due to the fact that it is implemented in an easy to debug manner, due to its modularity and to the fact that it has a test suite with near 90% coverage. In terms of future work, there is not much functionality left to add, but the test suite could be extended to full coverage.
